# TESLA Stock and Sentiment Analysis

## What This Project Does
This project aims to show how online sentiment affects Tesla stock. The first stage aims to predict one month of Tesla stock prices using an LSTM. Sentiment about Tesla tweets will then be analysed, given a sentiment score and added as a feature to determine how the inclusion of Tesla sentiment affects model accuracy. 

- We start by exploring and visualising the stock data through things like distributions and trends over time.
- We then select an LSTM model, search for optimised hyperparameters, train the model on these hyperparameters and use this to predict future stock.
- We then retrieve a number of tweets over the course of a year, clean these and perform sentiment analysis on them.
- We then explore the tweets and the seniment analysis through things like distributions and trends over time.
- Finally, we re-select an LSTM model and search for optimised hyperparameters and again train the model on these hyperparameters and observe an increased accuracy.
